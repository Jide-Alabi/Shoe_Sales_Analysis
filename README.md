### Project Overview

The goal of this project was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of sales data for shoes retailers in the USA, spanning the years 2022 and 2023. The analysis aimed to assess the retailer's performance across different regions, states, and sales methods, with a focus on key metrics such as Revenue, Units Sold, Expenses, and Profit. The final deliverable was to provide actionable insights that could inform sales strategies, inventory management, and marketing initiatives.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

1. Data was inspected to ensuring the dataset was complete and accurate.
2. Missing values, duplicate entries, and discrepancies in dates and numeric columns were handled with appropriate methods such as imputation and deletion.
3. Data integrity was ensured by verifying consistency in the column values, such as region names, sales methods, and product types.
4. Some columns were transformed to ensure consistency. For example, dates were standardized, and numeric values were verified for correctness and consistency across the dataset.
5. New columns were created to calculate key performance indicators such as profit and profit margin.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the Shoes sales data to answer key question, such as:

- What is the overall Retailers sales performance?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the peak sales periods?
- What are the sales performance accross different regions and states?

### Data Analysis

- I made use of pivot tables to quickly summarize and analyze my large datasets. 
- I did dynamic analysis using slicers on pivot tables to rearrange data and group it in different ways for deeper insight.
- I used conditional formatting to highlight specific values or patterns in my data.
- I used conditional formatting to create visual cues that make it easier to identify trends and outliers.
- I created charts and graphs to visualize my data and identify trends and patterns.
- I used charts and graphs to present my findings in a clear and concise manner.


### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. West gear, Foot Locker and Sports Direct respectively are the highest performing shoes retailers in terms of sales revenue and profit.
2. Nike shoes are top selling shoe product brand.
3. The overall sales rapidly increased in 2023 compared to 2022 with noticeable peak during the back to school season and the holiday season at quarter 3 and 4 of the year.
4. The West region and the state of New York is the highest performing Region and State respectively in terms of sales revenue and profit.
5. The Online Sales method is the best method in the overall sales analysis but the Outlet sales method is the prefered sales method in New York and California which are the States with the best sales performance.

### Recommendation

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:
- Retailers should invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue.
- Retailers should invest more in online marketing campaigns and promotions as the online sales method is shown to be the most effective in overall sales.
- Retailers should focus their inventory budget more on products like Nike, Salomon and Addidas shoes as the highest selling and profitable brands.
- Retailers should invest more in creating Outlets in the states of New York and California.

### Limitations

Lack of robust historical data over the years to have a better understanding of sales pattern and prediction.
